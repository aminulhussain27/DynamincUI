# DynamincUI
UI should be flexible in all resolutions, let it be mobile or tablet, even in landscape mode or portrait mode.
1st tab should be static with 3 data sets only, whereas 2nd and 3rd have dynamic data sets.
2nd Tab has limited data set whereas 3rd data set has very large data, so Optimizing large data set is very important.
Subtle animations on switching tabs are expected. Other animations would be appreciated.
